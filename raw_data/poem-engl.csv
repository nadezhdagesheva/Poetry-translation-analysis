1|Here am I - breathing,
2|working,
3|living
4|and writing my poetry
5|(my best to it giving).
6|Life and I glower
7|across at each other
8|and with it I struggle
9|with all my power.
10|Life and I quarrel,
11|but don't draw the moral
12|that I despise it.
13|No, just the opposite!
14|Though I should perish,
15|life with its brutal
16|claws of steel
17|still would I cherish,
18|still would I cherish!
19|Suppose round my neck they tie fast
20|the rope
21|and they ask:
22|Would you like one more hour to live?
23|I would instantly cry:
24|Untie!
25|Untie!
26|Come, quickly untie
27|the rope, you devils!
28|For Life there is nothing
29|I would not dare.
30|I would fly
31|a prototype plane in the sky,
32|climb into a roaring
33|rocket, exploring
34|alone
35|in space
36|distant
37|planets.
38|Still would I feel
39|a joyous thrill
40|gazing
41|up
42|at the blue sky.
43|Still would I feel
44|a joyous thrill
45|to be alive,
46|to go on living.
47|But look, suppose
48|you took - how much? -
49|a single grain
50|from this my faith,
51|then would I rage,
52|I would rage from pain
53|like a panther
54|pierced to the heart.
55|For what of me
56|would there remain?
57|After the theft
58|I'd be distraught.
59|To put it plainly
60|and more directly -
61|after the theft
62|I would be nought.
63|Maybe you wish
64|you could erase
65|my faith
66|my faith
67|in happy days,
68|my faith
69|that tomorrow
70|life will be finer,
71|life will be wiser?
72|Pray, how will you smash it?
73|With bullets?
74|No! That is useless!
75|Stop! It's not worth it!
76|My faith has strong armour
77|in my sturdy breast
78|and bullets able to shatter
79|my faith
80|do not exist,
81|do not exist!
