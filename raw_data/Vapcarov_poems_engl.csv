1|Faith|Here am I - breathing,
1|Faith|working,
1|Faith|living
1|Faith|and writing my poetry
1|Faith|(my best to it giving).
1|Faith|Life and I glower
1|Faith|across at each other
1|Faith|and with it I struggle
1|Faith|with all my power.
1|Faith|Life and I quarrel,
1|Faith|but don't draw the moral
1|Faith|that I despise it.
1|Faith|No, just the opposite!
1|Faith|Though I should perish,
1|Faith|life with its brutal
1|Faith|claws of steel
1|Faith|still would I cherish,
1|Faith|still would I cherish!
1|Faith|Suppose round my neck they tie fast
1|Faith|the rope
1|Faith|and they ask:
1|Faith|Would you like one more hour to live?
1|Faith|I would instantly cry:
1|Faith|Untie!
1|Faith|Untie!
1|Faith|Come, quickly untie
1|Faith|the rope, you devils!
1|Faith|For Life there is nothing
1|Faith|I would not dare.
1|Faith|I would fly
1|Faith|a prototype plane in the sky,
1|Faith|climb into a roaring
1|Faith|rocket, exploring
1|Faith|alone
1|Faith|in space
1|Faith|distant
1|Faith|planets.
1|Faith|Still would I feel
1|Faith|a joyous thrill
1|Faith|gazing
1|Faith|up
1|Faith|at the blue sky.
1|Faith|Still would I feel
1|Faith|a joyous thrill
1|Faith|to be alive,
1|Faith|to go on living.
1|Faith|But look, suppose
1|Faith|you took - how much? -
1|Faith|a single grain
1|Faith|from this my faith,
1|Faith|then would I rage,
1|Faith|I would rage from pain
1|Faith|like a panther
1|Faith|pierced to the heart.
1|Faith|For what of me
1|Faith|would there remain?
1|Faith|After the theft
1|Faith|I'd be distraught.
1|Faith|To put it plainly
1|Faith|and more directly -
1|Faith|after the theft
1|Faith|I would be nought.
1|Faith|Maybe you wish
1|Faith|you could erase
1|Faith|my faith
1|Faith|my faith
1|Faith|in happy days,
1|Faith|my faith
1|Faith|that tomorrow
1|Faith|life will be finer,
1|Faith|life will be wiser?
1|Faith|Pray, how will you smash it?
1|Faith|With bullets?
1|Faith|No! That is useless!
1|Faith|Stop! It's not worth it!
1|Faith|My faith has strong armour
1|Faith|in my sturdy breast
1|Faith|and bullets able to shatter
1|Faith|my faith
1|Faith|do not exist,
1|Faith|do not exist!
2|Spring In The Factory|She tried to get in with the morning shift,
2|Spring In The Factory|the motor grumbled,
2|Spring In The Factory|Looking stern and grim:
2|Spring In The Factory|You can't do that!
2|Spring In The Factory|I must account for it.
2|Spring In The Factory|Go ask the porter,
2|Spring In The Factory|if he'll let you in!
2|Spring In The Factory|But somehow she was full of willfulness
2|Spring In The Factory|and didn't ask the porter,
2|Spring In The Factory|just slipped through
2|Spring In The Factory|a dormer opened wide behind a press,
2|Spring In The Factory|then stuck her tongue out
2|Spring In The Factory|at the motor crew.
2|Spring In The Factory|And all at once an engine started humming,
2|Spring In The Factory|the workers seemed
2|Spring In The Factory|so clumsy and so slow,
2|Spring In The Factory|the motor, what the motor was,
2|Spring In The Factory|soon seeing,
2|Spring In The Factory|cried out in anger:
2|Spring In The Factory|She has got to go!
2|Spring In The Factory|Oh, no! a ladle of cast-iron cried
2|Spring In The Factory|with an ironic smile on his kind face.
2|Spring In The Factory|You silly, blatterring fathead, just you try it!
2|Spring In The Factory|We'll go on strike for her, if that's the case.
2|Spring In The Factory|The motor hushed. The breeze brought
2|Spring In The Factory|on its wings
2|Spring In The Factory|the teasing smell of earth
2|Spring In The Factory|from far away.
2|Spring In The Factory|A distant hum about the engine rings,
2|Spring In The Factory|and steps
2|Spring In The Factory|of plodding feet
2|Spring In The Factory|along the way.
2|Spring In The Factory|And all, who once the soil with joy
2|Spring In The Factory|had ploughed,
2|Spring In The Factory|like horses snorted, with their nostrils spread
2|Spring In The Factory|the others flung the windows wide and laughed
2|Spring In The Factory|and looked up
2|Spring In The Factory|at the blue sky
2|Spring In The Factory|overhead.
2|Spring In The Factory|Behind an engine someone
2|Spring In The Factory|rudely swore,
2|Spring In The Factory|a girl stuck up a merry tune and hushed.
2|Spring In The Factory|A young man shot at her
2|Spring In The Factory|a dart of fire,
2|Spring In The Factory|she looked away and blushed.
2|Spring In The Factory|The porter opened quietly the door,
2|Spring In The Factory|said: Who's got in? Will have to go,
2|Spring In The Factory|he will!
2|Spring In The Factory|But saw, smiled guiltily down at the floor,
2|Spring In The Factory|the scratched his head
2|Spring In The Factory|and whistled
2|Spring In The Factory|and was still.
3|The Factory|A factory. Clouds of smoke above.
3|The Factory|The people - simple,
3|The Factory|the life - hard, boring.
3|The Factory|Life with the mask and greasepaint off
3|The Factory|is a savage dog snarling.
3|The Factory|You must tirelessly fight,
3|The Factory|must be tough and persist,
3|The Factory|to extract from the teeth
3|The Factory|of the angry,
3|The Factory|bristling beast
3|The Factory|a crust.
3|The Factory|Slapping belts in the shed,
3|The Factory|screeching shafts overhead,
3|The Factory|and the air is so stale
3|The Factory|you can't easily
3|The Factory|deeply
3|The Factory|inhale.
3|The Factory|Not far off the spring breeze
3|The Factory|rocks the fields, the sun calls...
3|The Factory|Leaning skyward
3|The Factory|the trees
3|The Factory|shade -
3|The Factory|the factory walls.
3|The Factory|How unwanted,
3|The Factory|forgotten
3|The Factory|and strange
3|The Factory|are the fields!
3|The Factory|They
3|The Factory|have thrown in the dustbin
3|The Factory|the sky and its dreams.
3|The Factory|For to stray for a second
3|The Factory|or soften your heart,
3|The Factory|is to lose to no purpose
3|The Factory|your strong
3|The Factory|worker's
3|The Factory|arm.
3|The Factory|You must shout in the clatter
3|The Factory|and din of machines
3|The Factory|for your words
3|The Factory|to pass over.
3|The Factory|the spaces between.
3|The Factory|I shouted for years -
3|The Factory|an eternity...
3|The Factory|I gathered the others too shouted in chorus -
3|The Factory|the factory,
3|The Factory|the machinery
3|The Factory|and the man
3|The Factory|in the farthest
3|The Factory|darkest corner.
3|The Factory|This shout forged an alloy of steel
3|The Factory|and we armoured our life with its plate.
3|The Factory|Just try putting
3|The Factory|a spoke on the wheel -
3|The Factory|it's your own hand you'll break.
3|The Factory|You, factory,
3|The Factory|still seek to blind us
3|The Factory|with smoke and soot
3|The Factory|layer on layer.
3|The Factory|In vain! For you teach us to struggle,
3|The Factory|we'll bring
3|The Factory|the sun
3|The Factory|down to us here.
3|The Factory|So many
3|The Factory|toil-blackened
3|The Factory|faces
3|The Factory|under your tyranny smart,
3|The Factory|but one heart within you tirelessly
3|The Factory|beats with a thousand hearts.
4|Remembrance|I had a mate,
4|Remembrance|a good mate too,
4|Remembrance|but... he coughed in trouble.
4|Remembrance|A stoker by trade,
4|Remembrance|he carried the coal in a sack
4|Remembrance|and threw out the ash
4|Remembrance|on the night shift for twelve hours running.
4|Remembrance|I remember the eyes
4|Remembrance|of this mate of mine,
4|Remembrance|how they thirstily drank
4|Remembrance|every ray
4|Remembrance|which chanced
4|Remembrance|to pierce through the grime
4|Remembrance|and reach our cage.
4|Remembrance|How swift was the birth
4|Remembrance|of his feverish thirst
4|Remembrance|in Spring -
4|Remembrance|when outside
4|Remembrance|leaves murmur
4|Remembrance|and flocks
4|Remembrance|of birds
4|Remembrance|cross the sky.
4|Remembrance|I could feel
4|Remembrance|the appeal in his eyes
4|Remembrance|and the suffering,
4|Remembrance|painful suffering.
4|Remembrance|So slight was the grace they desired -
4|Remembrance|till Spring,
4|Remembrance|till next Spring...
4|Remembrance|Spring came
4|Remembrance|in her beauty,
4|Remembrance|with sun,
4|Remembrance|warm air
4|Remembrance|and roses.
4|Remembrance|The clear sky
4|Remembrance|bore us
4|Remembrance|the odour of violets.
4|Remembrance|But in us was darkness,
4|Remembrance|oppresive
4|Remembrance|and burdensome prose.
4|Remembrance|But then
4|Remembrance|our life was upset.
4|Remembrance|The boiler gave trouble,
4|Remembrance|suspiciously rumbled
4|Remembrance|and stopped.
4|Remembrance|I do not know why,
4|Remembrance|but may be because
4|Remembrance|the other lad died.
4|Remembrance|Perhaps I am wrong.
4|Remembrance|Maybe the hungry
4|Remembrance|boiler desired
4|Remembrance|familiar hands
4|Remembrance|to throw coal on the fire.
4|Remembrance|Perhaps it was so.
4|Remembrance|I do not know.
4|Remembrance|But it seemed to me, he
4|Remembrance|in his gabble and gasping
4|Remembrance|was plaintively asking:
4|Remembrance|Where has the other lad gone?
4|Remembrance|He - the other lad - died.
4|Remembrance|But look,
4|Remembrance|Spring is outside.
4|Remembrance|Far away
4|Remembrance|the birds dart through the sky.
4|Remembrance|But he'll see them no more.
4|Remembrance|Such a mate had I...
4|Remembrance|A good mate too...
4|Remembrance|But he coughed in trouble.
4|Remembrance|A stoker by trade,
4|Remembrance|he carried the coal in a sack
4|Remembrance|and threw out the ash
4|Remembrance|on the night shift for twelve hours running.
5|Romance|Today
5|Romance|I would like
5|Romance|to write
5|Romance|a poem
5|Romance|breathing
5|Romance|the spirit
5|Romance|of modern times,
5|Romance|beating
5|Romance|as proudly
5|Romance|as demon wings
5|Romance|that scour the earth
5|Romance|from pole to pole.
5|Romance|Why do folk grumble?
5|Romance|Why do they sigh
5|Romance|for the old
5|Romance|outworn
5|Romance|romantic jumble?
5|Romance|Romance is today in the engines that sing
5|Romance|in the blue upper air,
5|Romance|and you who have not understood their refrain
5|Romance|have no right to despair.
5|Romance|For their song brings
5|Romance|to men
5|Romance|the enduring strength
5|Romance|of supple steel wings.
5|Romance|These birds, before long,
5|Romance|shall cast seed
5|Romance|on the land.
5|Romance|Their echoing song
5|Romance|hails the freedom of man.
5|Romance|They shall fly over ocean
5|Romance|and tropical belt,
5|Romance|where corn is in motion,
5|Romance|where snows never melt.
5|Romance|I proclaim
5|Romance|new romance
5|Romance|being born
5|Romance|and maturing,
5|Romance|the aeroplane racing -
5|Romance|a power
5|Romance|embracing
5|Romance|the whole world today.
6|A Duel|We have come to close grips
6|A Duel|you and I have locked hands,
6|A Duel|from my heart the blood drips
6|A Duel|and you weaken. What then?
6|A Duel|One will be overthrown,
6|A Duel|one will be beaten -
6|A Duel|and you are the one.
6|A Duel|So you doubt it? You don't feel afraid?
6|A Duel|But I've planned every move to be made.
6|A Duel|I'm putting my heart in the fight,
6|A Duel|and you'll be beaten -
6|A Duel|degenerate, venomous life.
6|A Duel|It's not now that we're starting, you know.
6|A Duel|Our duel began long ago.
6|A Duel|Our duel with passion we've waged
6|A Duel|for many long days.
6|A Duel|For days we've locked
6|A Duel|our arms and wrists.
6|A Duel|I'll never forget
6|A Duel|your brutal fist.
6|A Duel|In the mine gas exploded.
6|A Duel|The layers of coal
6|A Duel|buried
6|A Duel|fifteen men below.
6|A Duel|Buried
6|A Duel|fifteen
6|A Duel|human
6|A Duel|corpses.
6|A Duel|One of them
6|A Duel|was
6|A Duel|I.
6|A Duel|By the door of a slum
6|A Duel|lies
6|A Duel|a smoking
6|A Duel|gun,
6|A Duel|while the corpse slowly freezes.
6|A Duel|No shouting,
6|A Duel|no din,
6|A Duel|one bullet
6|A Duel|then - dirt for the bin.
6|A Duel|It's easy as that...
6|A Duel|No fighting.
6|A Duel|No passion for life,
6|A Duel|and no fuss.
6|A Duel|Don't you know
6|A Duel|who it was?
6|A Duel|It
6|A Duel|was
6|A Duel|I.
6|A Duel|On the rainwashed pavement
6|A Duel|the victim lies
6|A Duel|shot dead from an ambush.
6|A Duel|The sky has been mined
6|A Duel|and will crash
6|A Duel|on the square.
6|A Duel|But the man
6|A Duel|lying there
6|A Duel|in the pool of blood
6|A Duel|is my brother -
6|A Duel|a fire
6|A Duel|of hatred and love
6|A Duel|in his glassy stare.
6|A Duel|The villain,
6|A Duel|the loathsome
6|A Duel|gunman
6|A Duel|instantly
6|A Duel|vanished from sight.
6|A Duel|You remember the rogue?
6|A Duel|It
6|A Duel|was
6|A Duel|I.
6|A Duel|But do you remember a child that died
6|A Duel|in Paris on the barricades,
6|A Duel|a child
6|A Duel|that died in battle
6|A Duel|with gory
6|A Duel|retrogression?
6|A Duel|The warm blood in his veins
6|A Duel|grew slowly
6|A Duel|cold as steel,
6|A Duel|and then his lips were parted
6|A Duel|on a fleeting smile.
6|A Duel|But though his lips turned blue,
6|A Duel|his eyes
6|A Duel|still burned with zeal
6|A Duel|as it his eyes were singing:
6|A Duel|Libert? ch?rie!
6|A Duel|The child
6|A Duel|lay there
6|A Duel|shot -
6|A Duel|in the chill grip of death.
6|A Duel|Do you know
6|A Duel|who it was?
6|A Duel|It was I!
6|A Duel|Do you remember
6|A Duel|an engine
6|A Duel|with gay
6|A Duel|optimism
6|A Duel|piercing
6|A Duel|the fog
6|A Duel|where even the birds
6|A Duel|do not dare
6|A Duel|to descend
6|A Duel|through the mist-laden air?
6|A Duel|An engine with wings
6|A Duel|that cleave
6|A Duel|the cold curtain
6|A Duel|and change the earth's orbit,
6|A Duel|with gasoline vapour's explosion
6|A Duel|clearing the way toward progress.
6|A Duel|The engine which sings high above
6|A Duel|is the work of my hands,
6|A Duel|and the song of my engine
6|A Duel|is the blood of my heart.
6|A Duel|The man whose shrewd eyes
6|A Duel|were glued
6|A Duel|to the wavering compass,
6|A Duel|the man
6|A Duel|who had dared to defy
6|A Duel|the cold northern frost
6|A Duel|and the mist -
6|A Duel|do you know
6|A Duel|who it was?
6|A Duel|It was
6|A Duel|I.
6|A Duel|I am here
6|A Duel|and there.
6|A Duel|I am everywhere. -
6|A Duel|A worker in Texas,
6|A Duel|Algerian docker,
6|A Duel|or poet...
6|A Duel|Everywhere am I!
6|A Duel|Do you think, life,
6|A Duel|you'll win?
6|A Duel|You evil and scowling,
6|A Duel|dirty thing!
6|A Duel|I
6|A Duel|blaze,
6|A Duel|you blaze,
6|A Duel|and we're both of us
6|A Duel|bathed in sweat.
6|A Duel|But you're draining your strength.
6|A Duel|Growing weaker,
6|A Duel|declining.
6|A Duel|That's why you're ferociously
6|A Duel|driving your sting into me,
6|A Duel|in the terror of imminent death
6|A Duel|maybe...
6|A Duel|For then
6|A Duel|in your place,
6|A Duel|with toil and sweat
6|A Duel|we'll build up
6|A Duel|together in company
6|A Duel|a life
6|A Duel|we desire,
6|A Duel|a life we need,
6|A Duel|and how fine
6|A Duel|that life will be!
7|A Letter|Do you remember
7|A Letter|the sea, the engines,
7|A Letter|and the holds full of wet dark
7|A Letter|and that great longing for the Philippines
7|A Letter|and for the big stars over Famagusta?
7|A Letter|Can you think of one sailor
7|A Letter|who did not look thirstily into the distance
7|A Letter|to where the breath of tropic winds
7|A Letter|blew softly in the dusk?
7|A Letter|Do you remember how, in us,
7|A Letter|little by little
7|A Letter|the last scraps of hope and faith in goodness
7|A Letter|and in man
7|A Letter|in the romantic
7|A Letter|and in empty
7|A Letter|dreams
7|A Letter|grew cold?
7|A Letter|Do you remember
7|A Letter|how very quickly
7|A Letter|we got caught in the trap of life?
7|A Letter|When we came to our senses
7|A Letter|it was too late.
7|A Letter|We were trapped.
7|A Letter|Like animals in a cage
7|A Letter|our eyes shone
7|A Letter|thirsty
7|A Letter|searching
7|A Letter|begging for mercy?
7|A Letter|We were young,
7|A Letter|we were so young!
7|A Letter|And then...then
7|A Letter|a sort of hatred
7|A Letter|began to take hold of our hearts.
7|A Letter|Like gangrene,
7|A Letter|no, like leprosy
7|A Letter|it spread,
7|A Letter|destroying our souls,
7|A Letter|knitting its cruel nets
7|A Letter|of emptiness
7|A Letter|and dark hopelessness,
7|A Letter|creeping into our blood, howling menace,
7|A Letter|and it was all so early, all so very early...
7|A Letter|And there -
7|A Letter|high in the sky
7|A Letter|the wings of seagulls
7|A Letter|still vibrated.
7|A Letter|The sky still glittered
7|A Letter|like mica
7|A Letter|and still it was all
7|A Letter|blue and boundless,
7|A Letter|still sails sank slowly
7|A Letter|over the horizon
7|A Letter|every evening
7|A Letter|and masts disappeared in the distance, but we had gone blind.
7|A Letter|For me all this belongs to the past - it is unimportant.
7|A Letter|But I shared with you the straw on the same plank bed,
7|A Letter|and I feel I have to tell you
7|A Letter|how hopeful and how optimistic I am now.
7|A Letter|This is what stops me
7|A Letter|from putting a hole
7|A Letter|through
7|A Letter|my head.
7|A Letter|It changes
7|A Letter|the bitterness in my heart
7|A Letter|into a force
7|A Letter|to fight
7|A Letter|which is in full flight
7|A Letter|today.
7|A Letter|And it will bring us back to the Philippines,
7|A Letter|and the big stars over Famagusta
7|A Letter|and the joy
7|A Letter|which has diminished in our hearts
7|A Letter|and the love gone dead for the engines
7|A Letter|for the vast blue of the sea
7|A Letter|where the tropic breezes breathe.
7|A Letter|It is night now.
7|A Letter|The engines are singing
7|A Letter|a song with a beat
7|A Letter|suggesting warmth, faith.
7|A Letter|If only you could know how I love life now!
7|A Letter|And how I hate
7|A Letter|all things
7|A Letter|meaningless...
7|A Letter|It all seems clear to me,
7|A Letter|as clear as it is that the sun will rise tomorrow,
7|A Letter|that with our heads we´ll break the ice.
7|A Letter|And that the sun on the dark horizon,
7|A Letter|yes
7|A Letter|our
7|A Letter|bright
7|A Letter|sun
7|A Letter|will shine.
7|A Letter|So let it single
7|A Letter|my wings
7|A Letter|like those of a small butterfly!
7|A Letter|I will not curse
7|A Letter|or complain,
7|A Letter|because I know
7|A Letter|we all have to die.
7|A Letter|But to die
7|A Letter|when the earth is shaking off
7|A Letter|the poisonous mold,
7|A Letter|when millions of people rise again,
7|A Letter|that is a song,
7|A Letter|yes, it is a song. 
8|A Song of a Man|We argued,
8|A Song of a Man|a lady and I
8|A Song of a Man|on the topic:
8|A Song of a Man|The man of our time.
8|A Song of a Man|The lady,
8|A Song of a Man|a peevish, excitable lady
8|A Song of a Man|impatiently stamped,
8|A Song of a Man|answered back.
8|A Song of a Man|Overwhelmed me with torrents
8|A Song of a Man|of muddled complaint
8|A Song of a Man|and a hailstorm of verbal
8|A Song of a Man|attack.
8|A Song of a Man|Just a moment, - I said. - Just a moment!
8|A Song of a Man|Look here...
8|A Song of a Man|But she cut me short, taking offence:
8|A Song of a Man|I beg you, stop talking.
8|A Song of a Man|I tell you - I hate man!
8|A Song of a Man|He doesn't deserve your defence.
8|A Song of a Man|I read of a fellow
8|A Song of a Man|who took up a chopper
8|A Song of a Man|against his own brother
8|A Song of a Man|and killed him.
8|A Song of a Man|Then washed
8|A Song of a Man|and attended a service at church,
8|A Song of a Man|and afterwards said he felt better.
8|A Song of a Man|I shuddered in horror, and felt none too bright.
8|A Song of a Man|But I'm not
8|A Song of a Man|very strong
8|A Song of a Man|in my theory,
8|A Song of a Man|so I quietly said,
8|A Song of a Man|as an honest man might:
8|A Song of a Man|Let's make a test case of a story.
8|A Song of a Man|The case took place in a village, Mogila.
8|A Song of a Man|The father had hidden
8|A Song of a Man|some money.
8|A Song of a Man|The son got to know of it,
8|A Song of a Man|took it by force
8|A Song of a Man|and then did away with his father.
8|A Song of a Man|But after a month, or
8|A Song of a Man|was it a week,
8|A Song of a Man|the authorities made an arrest.
8|A Song of a Man|But the court
8|A Song of a Man|doesn't function to give men a treat,
8|A Song of a Man|and sentenced the culprit to death.
8|A Song of a Man|They duly conducted the villain
8|A Song of a Man|to prison,
8|A Song of a Man|they gave him a number and can,
8|A Song of a Man|but there in the prison he met honest people,
8|A Song of a Man|became
8|A Song of a Man|a real man.
8|A Song of a Man|I don't know
8|A Song of a Man|the leaven that stirred him,
8|A Song of a Man|I don't know
8|A Song of a Man|the way it was made.
8|A Song of a Man|But a song
8|A Song of a Man|much more clearly than talking
8|A Song of a Man|opened his eyes to his face.
8|A Song of a Man|And then he would say:
8|A Song of a Man|O my God, how I floundered!
8|A Song of a Man|And here am I waiting
8|A Song of a Man|to swing.
8|A Song of a Man|When you're hungry
8|A Song of a Man|and dizzy
8|A Song of a Man|from hardship,
8|A Song of a Man|you've only to make a false step and you sink.
8|A Song of a Man|You wait like a bull for the slaughter,
8|A Song of a Man|turn about, in your eyes there's
8|A Song of a Man|the knife!
8|A Song of a Man|How unjust,
8|A Song of a Man|how unjust
8|A Song of a Man|is world order!
8|A Song of a Man|But perhaps we could better our life...
8|A Song of a Man|He struck up his song, sang it quietly
8|A Song of a Man|and slowly,
8|A Song of a Man|in front of him
8|A Song of a Man|life
8|A Song of a Man|floated forth like a wonderful vision...
8|A Song of a Man|He sang,
8|A Song of a Man|fell asleep
8|A Song of a Man|with smile...
8|A Song of a Man|Outside in the passage
8|A Song of a Man|they talk in a whisper.
8|A Song of a Man|There follows a moment of calm.
8|A Song of a Man|Then somebody cautiously opens the door.
8|A Song of a Man|A few people. Behind them a guard.
8|A Song of a Man|One of them
8|A Song of a Man|spoke
8|A Song of a Man|in a fearsome flat voice:
8|A Song of a Man|Get up on your feet, man! he bawled.
8|A Song of a Man|The others looked on,
8|A Song of a Man|with vacant expression
8|A Song of a Man|examined the dripping grey walls.
8|A Song of a Man|The man in the bed
8|A Song of a Man|understood that right now
8|A Song of a Man|life had finished with him,
8|A Song of a Man|and at once
8|A Song of a Man|he leapt up and brushed off the sweat from his brow.
8|A Song of a Man|Stared back
8|A Song of a Man|like a wild staring ox.
8|A Song of a Man|But little by little
8|A Song of a Man|the man understood
8|A Song of a Man|that his fear was no use,
8|A Song of a Man|he would die.
8|A Song of a Man|And a curious radiance
8|A Song of a Man|lit up his soul.
8|A Song of a Man|Shall we go now? he asked them.
8|A Song of a Man|All right.
8|A Song of a Man|He started
8|A Song of a Man|and they followed after him,
8|A Song of a Man|feeling
8|A Song of a Man|a curious
8|A Song of a Man|ominous chill.
8|A Song of a Man|The soldier thought:
8|A Song of a Man|Let's get it over and done with!
8|A Song of a Man|You're a tight corner now, pal.
8|A Song of a Man|Outside in the passage
8|A Song of a Man|they talked in a whisper.
8|A Song of a Man|The corners were hidden in shade.
8|A Song of a Man|At last they came down to the courtyard.
8|A Song of a Man|Above it
8|A Song of a Man|the sky shone with brightening sky
8|A Song of a Man|where a star in its brilliance bathed.
8|A Song of a Man|And fell to considering deeply his
8|A Song of a Man|grievous,
8|A Song of a Man|ferocious,
8|A Song of a Man|and blind
8|A Song of a Man|human
8|A Song of a Man|fate.
8|A Song of a Man|My fate is decided,
8|A Song of a Man|I'll hang from rope.
8|A Song of a Man|But that's far from the end,
8|A Song of a Man|I would say.
8|A Song of a Man|For a life will arrive that is fairer
8|A Song of a Man|than song,
8|A Song of a Man|and more beautiful than a spring day...
8|A Song of a Man|He remembered the song,
8|A Song of a Man|a thought flashed through his mind,
8|A Song of a Man|(In his eyes a small fire was kindling).
8|A Song of a Man|He smiled a broad smile full of brightness
8|A Song of a Man|and warmth,
8|A Song of a Man|braced his shoulders and then started singing.
8|A Song of a Man|What's you view of it? Maybe
8|A Song of a Man|you think we've discovered
8|A Song of a Man|a case of a complex, hysterical?
8|A Song of a Man|You can think just whatever you like of the matter -
8|A Song of a Man|today, my dear friend,
8|A Song of a Man|you're in error.
8|A Song of a Man|The man calmly,
8|A Song of a Man|sentence by sentence
8|A Song of a Man|so firmly recited the song,
8|A Song of a Man|that they stared at him
8|A Song of a Man|uncomprehending,
8|A Song of a Man|and watched him in fear and alarm.
8|A Song of a Man|And even the prison
8|A Song of a Man|was quaking in terror,
8|A Song of a Man|the darkness too panicked and ran.
8|A Song of a Man|The stars, smiling happily, shouted for joy,
8|A Song of a Man|cried out to him:
8|A Song of a Man|Bravo, young man!
8|A Song of a Man|From here on the story is clear. The rope
8|A Song of a Man|skillfully
8|A Song of a Man|dropped on the shoulders, then
8|A Song of a Man|death.
8|A Song of a Man|But still his contorted
8|A Song of a Man|and bloodless blue lips
8|A Song of a Man|to the words of the song were compressed.
8|A Song of a Man|And now we have come to the final denouement.
8|A Song of a Man|Well, what's your opinion, reader?
8|A Song of a Man|The lady,
8|A Song of a Man|had started to sob,
8|A Song of a Man|the poor woman
8|A Song of a Man|as if in a trance began shrieking:
8|A Song of a Man|How horrid, how horrid! You tell the whole story
8|A Song of a Man|as if you'd been there on the spot!...
8|A Song of a Man|What's horrid about it?
8|A Song of a Man|The man sang a song -
8|A Song of a Man|and that's very fine, is it not?
9|My Country|Above you Pirin
9|My Country|her granite peaks raises
9|My Country|hazily seen through the mists and the rain.
9|My Country|Over poor villages
9|My Country|eagles soar high,
9|My Country|and the wind whistles over the plain.
9|My Country|But there was a time
9|My Country|when, simple and candid,
9|My Country|my day-dreams would bear me along...
9|My Country|Life then was so bright
9|My Country|and free handed,
9|My Country|life then was so light,
9|My Country|and you were a song.
9|My Country|And now -
9|My Country|I've coped
9|My Country|with smoke,
9|My Country|with grease
9|My Country|and machines,
9|My Country|I've suffered
9|My Country|privation, the yoke -
9|My Country|wherever they struggle
9|My Country|for bread.
9|My Country|And something broke
9|My Country|in my heart.
9|My Country|I groaned with the smart,
9|My Country|but found no release.
9|My Country|So then I looked back
9|My Country|and bitterly spat,
9|My Country|both on you
9|My Country|and on life itself too.
9|My Country|Today you are near,
9|My Country|much nearer by far than my mother,
9|My Country|but today I am red with the smear
9|My Country|of blood that is needlessly shed
9|My Country|I lie choking at night
9|My Country|with the blood of the fight
9|My Country|of your heroes
9|My Country|on foreigners' pay...
9|My Country|It hurts me, my country,
9|My Country|so terribly, cruelly hurts,
9|My Country|that blood which so spurts,
9|My Country|and I want to know:
9|My Country|did all that
9|My Country|have to be
9|My Country|so?
9|My Country|All around me
9|My Country|gloom.
9|My Country|And in the gloom - toil and prostration.
9|My Country|Starvation.
9|My Country|You've lagged for hundreds of years.
9|My Country|And somewhere the pulse of life throbs,
9|My Country|and plant
9|My Country|after plant
9|My Country|keeps appearing,
9|My Country|propellers are whizzing...
9|My Country|But my people
9|My Country|are working
9|My Country|and dying
9|My Country|as in the old days
9|My Country|of the bronze age.
9|My Country|But I love you again,
9|My Country|the country of Gotse and Dahme,
9|My Country|because I was bred
9|My Country|because I was hardened by you.
9|My Country|And in my young heart I uphold
9|My Country|the turbulent banner,
9|My Country|the strenuous purpose
9|My Country|of all without shelter and bread.
10|Land|This land,
10|Land|That I am treading on now,
10|Land|This land,
10|Land|That is woken by the south in the spring.
10|Land|I do not know this land - my land,
10|Land|This land, forgive me for saying: Is somebody else's!
10|Land|I head out early.
10|Land|Along a factory road
10|Land|Countless workers clothes swarm together.
10|Land|We are merged into one heart, one mind,
10|Land|But this country... is not mine!
10|Land|Above my land,
10|Land|In spring-time
10|Land|Splendor is reflected
10|Land|Waterfalls storm from the radiant Sun.
10|Land|You feel it close to your heart,
10|Land|And watch as endless rows of flowers blossom.
10|Land|Above my land,
10|Land|Up to the skies
10|Land|Pirin rises.
10|Land|The pines chant Ilinden stories in a chorus.
10|Land|Above Ohrid, the azure blends into the space,
10|Land|And further beneath, rainbows are glistening as one on the Aegean.
10|Land|I will recall,
10|Land|And the blood will rush to
10|Land|My heart, melting into some kind of gentleness....
10|Land|My birth place! A place so beautiful....
10|Land|Mothered in storms,
10|Land|Nursed with blood amid fierce blizzards.
10|Land|Along Belassitza wire-nets...
11|A Song|Over Pirin
11|A Song|howling winds
11|A Song|the forests sway.
11|A Song|We were seven
11|A Song|set out to fight
11|A Song|far away
11|A Song|very soon then
11|A Song|we lost sight
11|A Song|both of Pirin
11|A Song|and its starry night.
11|A Song|In the thickets
11|A Song|with wild beasts we slept
11|A Song|and across the border
11|A Song|thus we crept.
11|A Song|On the grass
11|A Song|we seemed to see the stains
11|A Song|of our fathers' blood
11|A Song|washed by the rains.
11|A Song|And we seemed to hear
11|A Song|the green leaves say
11|A Song|where our mothers
11|A Song|in the ground buried lay.
11|A Song|We knew
11|A Song|when we saw earth ruddy-red,
11|A Song|that our first love
11|A Song|there lay dead.
11|A Song|Seven of us
11|A Song|set out to fight.
11|A Song|Only three of us
11|A Song|came back in the night.
