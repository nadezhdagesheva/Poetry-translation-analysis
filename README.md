# Poetry-translation-analysis


### Analysis of a selection of poems by the Bulgarian poet Nikola Vapcarov (1909 - 1942)

##### The goal of this assignment is to explore the preciseness of translating a poem. Two main approaches are undertaken:


1. Explore a single poem and four translations (hence 5 language version of the same poem). Extract the most common words and compare them to the original ones. 
   
   
         o	An update of the Bulgarian stop word list was conducted in order to achieve the first task. 


2. Explore the topics and the most important and unique tokens per document (TF-IDF analysis) of a total set of 11 poems – a Bulgarian original and English version. Compare and contrast.


*Note: always save your .R script with “Save with Encoging” => “UTF-8”.*


All necessary input files can be obtained from “raw_data” folder, while all output files and further analysis from the “output” files. Two .R files are available – the “stop-word-bg.R” and “poem-analysis.R”.
